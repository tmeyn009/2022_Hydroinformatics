    "## The procedure of Hydraulic Model Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone working with water distribution models agrees that calibration is essential in developing a helpful model. Calibration is achieved by comparing model results with field observations (measurements) and adjusting the model (e.g., for roughnesses) so that it produces numbers that agree with valid field observations (Walski 2000). As stated in Walski (2017), virtually every hydraulic water distribution model requires some level of calibration adjustment to represent the actual system's behavior. To achieve good calibration, the modeler (in this case, you) faces an overwhelming number of potential adjustments. In the past, researchers have developed methods that use optimization algorithms to help achieve good calibration for their models. Within this assignment, you will learn how to write a computer program that uses mathematical optimization algorithms to calibrate an entire water distribution network based on actual measurement data.\n",

    "## Mathematical definition of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical optimization has various real-world applications in economics, engineering, decision making, to name just a few fields. Mathematically, an optimization problem can be defined by finding the minimum of an objective function (also called fitness function) in the following way\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{R}} f(\\mathbf{x}) \\quad s.t. \\quad \\begin{cases} c_i(\\mathbf{x}) = 0 \\quad i \\in \\mathcal{E} \\\\ c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0 \\quad i \\in \\mathcal{I} \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{x}$ is a n-dimensional parameter vector of real numbers ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{n}$), called the trial or optimization variables, $f$ is the (scalar) objective function that one wants to minimize, $c_i$ are (non-)linear constraint functions that the parameters $\\mathbf{x}$ have to satisfy. The constraints $c_i$ can be equality constraints, where $\\mathcal{E}$ is the set of indices belonging to these equality constraints, or inequality constraints represented by the set $\\mathcal{I}$  of all inequality constraints for the specific optimization problem. Points in the parameter space $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{n}$ fulfilling these constraints are called feasible points. Note that maximization problems in the equation above can be formulated by multiplying the objective function with -1, hence describing optimization in general. Since the parameter consists of real numbers, the problem formulated in the equation above is called a continuous nonlinear optimization problem. The roughness calibration belongs to this class of problems, where pipe roughness values $\\mathbf{x}$ are estimated through solving the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since usually more pipes are present in a water distribution system than measurements and calibration scenarios, pipes with the similar properties (i.e., concerning material, age, diameter, hydraulic conditions, or locations) are grouped in clusters with the same roughness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the fitness function, we will use the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) to minimize the difference between measured pressures $p_{ij}$ and simulated pressures $\\hat{p}_ij(\\mathbf{x})$, simulated/measured at $N_p$ different pressure measurement locations in the system, for $N_S$ different scenarios defined through different demand loading conditions or hydrant flows, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ =  \\text{SSE}(\\mathbf{x}) \\ = \\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N_S} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} \\left( p_{ij} - \\hat{p}_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right)^2 \\qquad \\rightarrow \\qquad \\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{R}} f(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, roughness parameter estimation is formulated as an inverse problem, and the roughness parameters are found that fit the measured values the best with a heuristic optimization algorithm like Differential Evolution.\n"

    "## Differential Evolution algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm was introduced by Ken Price and Rainer Storn two decades ago (Storn and Price 1995, 1997). You do not have to program the algorithm yourself. You can take it straight away from `scipy.optimize`, where the function `differential_evolution` is found. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the algorithm and the input parameters better, here is an explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "DE works the same way as GAs. The algorithm is again population-based. Individuals—who are now called candidate solutions or agents— build a population of solutions. The candidates move around the search space and are altered and combined by simple algebraic formulas. The crucial idea behind DE is that this algorithm generates new candidate solutions by adding a weighted difference vector between two population agents to a third agent (Storn and Price 1995). This process can again be seen as a sequence of mutation, recombination and selection operators. The mutation leads again to new solutions in the parameter space. At the same time, recombination combines the information contained in two agents, one from the original population and one as a result of mutation, to obtain new candidate solutions. Confusingly, the mutation in the DE algorithm is also similar to recombination in GAs (according to Storn and Price 1995).\n",
    "Furthermore, these operators are used in a different order than GAs since mutation and recombination are switched. Suppose a candidate solution leads to better fitness values. In that case, it is selected to replace the agent with whom its fitness was compared and becomes part of the population in the following iteration. Thus, in general, this selection procedure is greedier than in GAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the algorithm starts, a first population $P(t = 0)$ of $\\mu$ solutions has to be generated randomly within the boundaries of the parameter space. This is called the initialization phase.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation\n",
    "    \n",
    "The mutation operator generates new parameter vectors—called donors—by adding a weighted difference vector with weights Fi between (at least) two population members xr1 and xr2 randomly drawn from the population to a third member, which (i) can also be randomly drawn xr3 from the population, or (ii) is the same vector as used for recombination x j or (iii) is the best solution xbest of the current population. Which of these three cases is applied depends on the mutation strategy that is used. The table shows different mutation strategies described in Storn 1996. The figure below the table shows the mutation on the DE/best/1 strategy example. Two random vectors are taken from the population, their difference vector is built, which is subsequently multiplied by the mutation factor F1. F1 controls the amplification of the differential variation (Storn and Price 1995). It then adds to the best solution xbest to generate the donor vector v. Once the donor vector v j is produced, it is passed to the recombination operator.\n",

    "$$ u_i,j \\ = \\ \\begin{cases} v_{i,j} \\quad \\text{if rand}_{i,j} \\leq CR \\\\ x_{i,j} \\quad \\text{else}\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{rand}_{i, j}$ is a uniform random number drawn within the interval $\\text{rand}_{i, j} \\ \\in [0, 1]$   and $CR$ is the crossover probability parameter chosen from $CR \\in [0, 1]$ determined by the user. $\\mathbf{x}_j$ is called the target vector, and $j_{rand}$ is a randomly drawn integer, assuring that at least one parameter differs between the trial vector $\\mathbf{u}_j$ and the target vector $\\mathbf{x}_j$. Thus, if $\\text{rand}_{i, j}$ is smaller than $CR$ for the i-th element of the vectors, the i-th element is transferred from the donor to the trial vector. Otherwise, the i-th element is taken from the target vector.\n",

The demand data was retrieved from billing information between 2012 and 2015. A nodal demand equal to the average consumption of the customers during this period has been allocated to the nodes in the system. In total, 35 hydrants are situated in the water distribution system, where outflows are generated for calibration, and leakage localization purposes and pressures were measured. The system consists mainly of PVC and PE pipes, but also some steel and cast iron parts can be found in the system. Noticeable is the high pressure of over 9 bar in some parts of the system resulting from huge elevation differences between the tank and the northern area of the network—North elevation is 404.5 m, South elevation is 505.2 m. No pressure-reducing valves are installed in the measurement zone.\n",

    "## Why do we open fire hydrants?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key with tests in high flow regimes is to ensure that the head loss between the source and the measurement location is more significant than the measurement errors. During normal flow conditions, the headloss is low. Therefore, pressure comparisons cannot reveal problems that occur due to headloss between the boundary nodes and pressure measurement locations. For example, during high flow conditions at peak demands, discrepancies can be detected that are not obvious when the head loss is low in the system. The most likely sources of error are (partly) closed valves, mismatches in the pipe roughnesses, pipe diameters, false connections in the hydraulic model compared to reality, or wrong demands. "

    "## Calibration scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration experiments were conducted in the night from the 11th to the 12th of April 2016. The minimum night flow (MNF) time has been chosen so that the influence of customer demand is minimal on the calibration measurements. For successful roughness parameter assessment, high velocities have to be produced in the system (Walski 2000) to guarantee that the effect of roughness on pressure becomes more significant than the measurement uncertainties. For that reason, hydrants were opened to produce large water flows in the system. The pressure was measured during the calibration night at 12 locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most time-consuming part of the night measurements has been relocating and connecting the hydrant measurement devices. Hence, a scheduled hydrant opening scheme was developed where hydrants were opened in parallel to produce supplementary calibration scenarios without relocating the devices. This promised the most effective use of the short time frame during the MNF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement campaign was initially planned with three measurement devices. The scenarios have been generated in two stages: In the first round, hydrants were opened at positions A, B, and C. The generated outflows and measurement times are listed in the tables below. The measurements were taken between $tstart$ and $tend$. $tstart$ is the time when the hydrants are already fully opened, and the pressures in the system are steadied down. $tend$ is the time-step before the hydrants were closed again. Seven scenarios— named from $S_1$ to $S_7$ were generated through the first round through the parallel opening. $S_1$, $S_4$, and $S_6$ were generated by opening a single hydrant. Hydrants were opened in parallel in scenarios $S_2$, $S_3$, $S_5$, and $S_7$. Subsequently, the measurement devices were moved to positions D, E, and F. The second measurement round was performed by opening these hydrants. The corresponding outflows with start- and end-times are listed again in the table below\n",

Therefore, outflows generated at locations B and D were not measured directly at the hydrants. That is why they are marked with a star in tje tables. The corresponding outflows have been estimated by subtracting the MNF from the corresponding inflow measurements at the hydrant openings. The minimum night flow has been calculated by averaging the inflow according to pressures between 1:22 and 1:31 in the morning. The night flow results in $Q_{MNF}$ = 1.217 [L/s]. The system’s inflow $Q(t)$ and the measured pressures $p(t)$ during the scenarios can be seen in the figure below.
